# Grab Objects
forked from [github.com/decentraland-scenes/grab-objects](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/grab-objects)

## Description
Create a "placeable object" - in this case a cocktail glass - which can be picked up and placed on other objects, so long as that object has a collider. If the player picks up an object and attempts to place it on an object without a collider, the object is simply put on the ground in front of the player.

## Instructions
Use your mouse to look around and <kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> keys on your keyboard to move forward, left, backward and right respectively. The <kbd>E</kbd> or <kbd>F</kbd> key or mouse click can be used to pick up an object. Place an object using the <kbd>E</kbd> key.
